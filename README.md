# Convolution-Neural-Network
Creating MY OWN convolutional neural network from scratch. I'm building off another project of mine where I built a simple [Neural Network](https://github.com/AmarJ/NN). I'm primarily using the cs231n Stanford course [notes](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) and the AlexNet [research paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) as a reference.
